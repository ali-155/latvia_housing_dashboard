# Latvia Housing Dashboard

This project analyzes Latvia's housing market to generate *key performance indicators (KPIs)* such as:

- 🏠 Average price per m²  
- 📈 Year-on-year % change  
- 💰 Price-to-income ratio  
- 🔄 Rent vs Buy index  

The goal is to track housing affordability and trends across Latvian regions, using *Python for data cleaning & processing* and *Tableau  for visualization*.
